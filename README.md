## Introduction
A docker image based on Arch Linux with the s6 process supervisor

### What is Arch Linux?
Arch Linux is a simple lightweight Linux Distribution with a strong community.  It is simple, modern, pragmatic, user centric and versatile.  Arch Linux uses a rolling release model. The distro expects the user to be willing to make some effort to understand the systems operation and is popular among more advanced linux users.

### What is the s6-overlay?
The [s6-overlay project](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) is a series of init scripts and utilities to ease creating Docker images using s6 as a process supervisor.  The s6-overlay makes it easy to take advantages of s6 while still operate like other Docker images.  The s6 init system provides many helpful tools to initialize and manage processes as the Docker container starts.
